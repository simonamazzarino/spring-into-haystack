Welcome to the ðŸŒ¸ [Spring Into Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/spring-into-haystack) ðŸŒ¸ your chance to cultvate something useful, elegant, and powerful â€” just like spring itself! ðŸŒ¼

## ðŸª» Your Spring Challenge

Your mission is to build a **tool-using Haystack Agent** that acts as an **MCP Client** and connects to the [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server). Once connected, your Agent will be able to call GitHub tools â€” all through the power of the Model Context Protocol.

To get started, check out the scaffolded starter code in [`github-agent.py`](src/github-agent.py). Youâ€™ll need to:
- Implement the mssing parts
- Configure your Agent to connect to the GitHub MCP server
- Make sure the Agent can reason and act based on tool outputs

> Note: The [**official GitHub MCP Server**](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) requires **Docker** to run. If you're unable to use Docker (e.g. due to system limitations or permissions), you can use the [**legacy GitHub MCP Server**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github), which is **deprecated** but can be run easily run with `npx`. Note that the set of available tools differs between the official and legacy servers.

### âœ… Test Your Agent: Find the Hidden Typo

To verify your Agent is working correctly, weâ€™ve planted a **typo somewhere in this very README**.

Once your Agent is fully wired up and reasoning correctly, it should:
1. **Detect the typo** by reading this README via the GitHub MCP server  
2. **Open a GitHub issue** describing the typo clearly in the issue body

This will prove that your Agent can:
- Understand the task and make a plan
- Select the right tool(s) from the GitHub MCP server
- Execute an action on GitHub

## ðŸŒ· How to Participate

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub
2. **Fill in the missing peices** in [`github-agent.py`](src/github-agent.py) to build your MCP-connected Agent
3. **Push your code** to your forked repo
4. **[Submit the link](https://forms.gle/VbyhQrKz1niyzBmGA) to the repo** so we can see your creation in full bloom!
